        Hey lovely reader, are you still reading my blog till this line? If so,
        I love you. This is what is blogging. Something which I write out of the
        experience is being shared with the right audience who is also willing
        to read you.

        Blogging means you share knowledge or feeling with somebody in order to
        give them value for what they are looking for. To identify if your
        lovely reader is really engaging with you or not, you can simply see if
        they are engaging with your content or not.
